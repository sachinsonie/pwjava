Ans 1 To create object in java we use 'new' keyword and we can make object in class.
      Class objectName = new className();
      public class cal{
      int a=10,b=20; 
      public static void main(String [] args){
      cal obj = new cal();
      int result = obj.a + obj.b;
      System.out.prinln(result);
      } 
}

Ans 2 new keyword is use to create instance of object and it alloted memory to object.

Ans 3 Static variable 
      Instance variable - outside main method
      Local variable - Inside main method

Ans 4 Instance variable
      - Outside of method 
      - Accessible to all methods 
      - Destroy when object is destroyed
      - Access thorugh class
      - Have default value if not assign
      - Have access modifier

      Local variable
      - Inside block and mathod
      - Destroy when method or block exited
      - Created when block is started
      - Not assign with default values sometime
      - Need initialaized before use.
      - Do not have access modifier

Ans 5 Instance variable are allot in heap and local variable are stored in stack memory.

Ans 6 Method overloding allow a class to have many same method name but with different parameters. it increase code reusebility and reduce complixity of code.
