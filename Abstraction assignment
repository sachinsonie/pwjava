                                                                  INTERFACE ASSIGNMENT
Ams 1 An interface in java is a machanism that is used to achieve complete abstraction .it is basically a kind of class that contains only constants and abstract methods

Ans 2 Only abstract and public modifier are allowed in interface 

Ans 3 Use of interface
An inteface is used to achieve full abstraction
An interface is best way to expose project API to other project
An interface is used to customise features of sofrware differently for different objects
An interface helps in achieve the functionality of multiple inheritance.

Ans 4 Difference in abstraction and interface
Abstract class can have abstract and non abstract methods   | interface can have only abstract methods since java 8 it can have default and static methods also
Abstract class dosen't support multiple inheritance         | interface support multiple inheritance
Abstract can have final, non final and static and non static| interface has only static and final variables
variables                                                   |  
Abstraction class can provide implementation of interface   | interface can't  provide implementation of abstract class
The abstract keyword is used to declare abstract class      | interface keyword is used to declare the interface
Abstract class can extended using 'extends' keyword         | interface can be implement using 'implements' keyword
eg - public abstract class shape{                           | eg - public interface DrawAble{
     public abstract void draw();                           |      void draw();
}                                                           |      }
